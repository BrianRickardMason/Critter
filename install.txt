Installation instructions:
1. setup the database

    use the SQL scripts in Rites/Database/Persistence/ in the same order they are named (000_*, 100_*, and so on):

        # su - postgres
        $ psql < Rites/Database/Persistence/000*
        ...

    If you get "invalid locale" error, you need to enable en_US.UTF-8 locale first (debian: dpkg-reconfigure locales) and restart the system

2. If you're running in broker mode (default): run the broadcast daemon, so the critters are able to communicate

        $ python BroadcastDaemon.py BrDaemon

3. run the essentials in the following order: Librarian, Graph, Balancer, Worker

        $ python CribrarianMain.py L
        $ python GraphYeetiMain.py G1
        $ python BalancerMain.py B
        $ python WorkerMain.py W1
    
4. executing Scheduler will occasionally schedule some work for execution

        $ python Criduler.py S

    should eventually show something like:
    [2012-07-29 21:09:08,571][   SchedulerCommandProcessor][    INFO] - New graph execution needed.
