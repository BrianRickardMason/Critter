1) Problems with GraphRiteSession that is spawned although not all information about the Graph is available.

Reproducible @perun. To be investigated.

AssertionError: The graph name has not any works associated.

a) The Cribrarians must be started first.
b) The subscription channels must prevent messages from being got from the queue.

4) Too many ssh at a time causes the server to drop connections.

SOLUTION: A "sleep" to be introduced in CrittStarter.
